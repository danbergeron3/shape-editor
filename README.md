# Shaper.IO
This repository contains the code for my prototype 2-d shape editor Shaper.IO. I created it as a project to better understand the logic behind developing computer graphics. 
## Libraries 
-	Uses Fabric.JS for the shape editor itself. 
-	Uses Bootstrap for some of the UI elements.
-	Uses JScolor for color picker.
